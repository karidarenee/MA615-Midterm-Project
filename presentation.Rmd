# Possible Questions:  
1.Comparison of strawberry yields between states.  
2.How does the pesticide application vary between states and yearsï¼Ÿ  
3.Is there any relationship between Level of Bee Toxicity and Carcinogen Level?

# Proportion of pesticides dataset
```{r, include = TRUE, fig.align='center'}
state_fig()
```

# Maps of Strawberries Yield in CWT/Acre
```{r, include = TRUE}
map.straw(strawb_yield[strawb_yield$Data.Item == "STRAWBERRIES - YIELD, MEASURED IN CWT / ACRE",], "Strawberries Yield (CWT/Acre))\n2015-2020")
#map.straw(df.app, "Strawberries Yield(LB/ACRE/APPLICATION)\n2016 2018 2019")
#map.straw(df.year, "Strawberries Yield(LB/ACRE/YEAR)\n2016 2018 2019")
```

# Maps of Pesticide Applications
```{r, include = TRUE}
map.straw(df.num,"Average Number of Pesticide Applications \n2016 2018 2019")
#map.straw(df.PCT, "Strawberries Yield(PCT OF AREA BEARING)\n2016 2018 2019") 
```

```{r, include = F,warning=FALSE,results = FALSE}
# Applications of Bee Toxins
bee_tox()
```

```{r,include = F,warning=FALSE,results = FALSE}
# Applications of Carcinogens
carc_apps()
```

# Comparison of Toxicities and Application


```{r,include = TRUE}
group_bars()
```

# Conclusions:
1.From the bin plot, we can see that the proportions of strawberries numbers have a significant difference between states. California has the largest share and Washington has the smallest.  
2.From the bar chart, we can see that all strawberries measured in number with toxicity_bee exist with slight level of carcinogen.There does not exist strawberries measured in number with toxicity_bee in the 2 and 3 level of carcinogen.
