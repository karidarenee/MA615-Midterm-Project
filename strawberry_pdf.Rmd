# 1. Introduction

In this project, we use the data sets strawberries, insecticides, and herbicides-fungicides-other from USDA. We first wrangled these files, finished data cleaning and organizing the final data set; then we start to visualize and explore the data. This report focus on 2 main parts: Data cleaning and EDA.

- Data cleaning: We wrangle the data sets strawberries, insecticides, and herbicides-fungicides-other. Separate some columns and eliminate the redundancy.
- EDA: We plot a pie chart with a proportion of dataset by states, maps of comparison of strawberry yields and pesticide application between states and years, and a dot plot of the relationship between the level of Bee Toxicity and Carcinogen level.

Besides, we deploy a shiny app [Shiny_strawberries](https://rongli.shinyapps.io/shiny/) for data display and exploration.


# 2. EDA -- We added mouse over into our plots.

## 2.1 Subsets by different measurement

```{r, echo=FALSE}
table(strawberry$`Measurement(s)`)
strawberry$`Measurement(s)` = str_trim(strawberry$`Measurement(s)`)
df.lb = subset(strawberry, `Measurement(s)` == "MEASURED IN LB")
df.app = subset(strawberry, `Measurement(s)` == "MEASURED IN LB / ACRE / APPLICATION")
df.year = subset(strawberry, `Measurement(s)` == "MEASURED IN LB / ACRE / YEAR")
df.num = subset(strawberry, `Measurement(s)` == "MEASURED IN NUMBER")
df.PCT = subset(strawberry, `Measurement(s)` == "MEASURED IN PCT OF AREA BEARING")
```

## 2.2 Calculate proportions of strawberries by 'Measurements=Number'

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df.num<-tibble::as_tibble(df.num)
#Count frequency/proportion for each state
df.num %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(freq = n / sum(n))
```

## 2.3 Calculate proportions of values(numbers) grouped by 'toxicity_bee'

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df.value<-tibble::as_tibble(df.num$Value)
df.toxicity_bee<-tibble::as_tibble(df.num$toxicity_bee)
df.toxicity<-cbind(df.value,df.toxicity_bee)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Rename column 2 into 'toxicity_bee'
names(df.toxicity)[2]<- 'toxicity_bee'

df.toxicity %>%
  group_by(toxicity_bee) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(freq = n / sum(n))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
options(warn = oldw)
```

# 2.4 Show a pie chart with proportion in number of three states: CA, FL, WA
```{r, include = TRUE}
state_fig()
```
The proportions of strawberries numbers have a significant difference between states. California has the largest share, and Washington has the smallest one. (CA > FL > WA)  

# 2.5 Show a map of Strawberries Yield measured in CWT/Acre
```{r, include = TRUE}
map.straw(strawb_yield[strawb_yield$Data.Item == "STRAWBERRIES - YIELD, MEASURED IN CWT / ACRE",], "Strawberries Yield (CWT/Acre))\n2015-2020")
```


# 2.6 Show a map of average number of pesticide application
```{r, include = TRUE}
map.straw(df.num,"Average Number of Pesticide Applications \n2016 2018 2019")
```


# 2.7 Show the correlation of average number of Bee Toxicity measured in applications and carcinogen level
```{r,include = TRUE}
group_bars()
```
From this graph, we can get the interesting finding that all strawberries measured in number with toxicity_bee exist with slight level of carcinogen. There does not exist strawberries measured in number with toxicity_bee in the 2 (medium) and 3 (high) level of carcinogen.
